• EGL 
• Limited 2D acceleration via PVR2D API 
Window Systems 

The following Window Systems are supported, on Linux: 

• Null Window System (with Pixmap support) 
• X11 support(DRI/DRM Xorg driver) 
Buffer Swap modes 

The following modes of buffer swapping are supported, 

• Front (1 buffer), Flip (chained buffers) 
Selection of these modes is done via entries in /etc/powervr.ini. Please refer to http:/ / processors. wiki. ti. com/ 
index.php/SGXDbg#WindowSystem 

Extensions

RN 4 04 00 02 3 
• X11 window system has been validated with the Xorg file system available as part of the graphics SDK 
installation(targetfs/XSGX folder). The Xorg server version that has been used/validated as part of this graphics 
SDK release is 1.7.5 and it has been validated with enlightenment window manager only (downloaded/used from 
Narcissus angstrom distribution in April). 
Additional Packages 
Demonstration packages for Texture streaming extension are available at the below link,

Debugging SGX driver related issues 
For debugging issues with SGX driver and frequently asked questions, please go through 
http:/ / processors. wiki. ti. com/ index. php/ SGXDbg 
Fixed in this Release 
• [SDOCM00082981] : Implement wait for vsync functionaliy using the VPSS provided vsync register callback 
mechanism. 
Limitations/ Known Issues 
• [SDOCM00061522] FrontEGL mode of swapping buffers may show artifacts (ex, lines at the top), when 
operating with DVI output. 
• [SDOCM00061276] Texturing via glTexImage2D will result in CPU utilisation depending on size of texture. 
• Using OpenVG will result in CPU utilisation depending on complexity of Vector Graphics operations. 
• Lock related warnings seen with 2.6.37 kernel (Linux PSP 04.02.00.07) on OMAP35x/AM35xx/37xx platforms. 
Please refer to sgxdbg page - http:/ / processors. wiki. ti. com/ index. php/ 
SGXDbg#Lock_related_warnings_seen_on_OMAP35x. 2FAM35x. 2F37xx_with_2. 6. 37_kernel for more 
details. 
• [SDOCM00063852] bc_example.ko is not installed as it is not supported, but default rc.pvr from IMG will refer 
to this. Please use updated bufferclass_ti driver. 
• [SDOCM00063807] All SDK demos should be exited by pressing 'q'. Ctrl-C can result in unknown behaviour 
after the closure. 
• [SDOCM00063803]OGLESShadowTechniques demo will hang and reboot is required. 
• [SDOCM00068272],[SDOCM00068322] Blue line on top of DVI display for PolyBump demo, thin line on top 
for sgx_render_flip_test demo 
• [SDOCM00079480] Kernel lockup observed with OGLES2SkyBox2 demo in flip mode on OMAP35x (with 
SGX 530 core 1.0.3 only). Works fine on OMAP35x(with SGX 530 core 1.2.1) and all other platforms. 
• [SDOCM00082511] Graphics SDK - Xorg driver not supported on OMAP35x EVM with SGX Core 1.0.3. Also 
some applications lead to Hardware recovery errors on SGX core 1.0.3. However these work fine on all other 
platforms with other SGX cores.

1. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute orPublicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License.
You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or PubliclyPerform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License.
This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice fromany Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
2. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license(either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under one of thelicenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"), you must comply with theterms of the Applicable License generally and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) Youmay not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the ApplicableLicense; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) whenYou Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted tothat recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject tothe terms of the Applicable License.
3. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to themedium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute,

Thecredit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors ofthe Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by thisSection for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by theOriginal Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), inwhich any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author'shonor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of thisLicense (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
